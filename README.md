The UI/UX design for the Little lemon website when the user wants to reserve a table. 

- The persona presents the case and background of a potential user

- The journeyMap presents the thought process and feelings of the user when navigating through the webpages

- the wireframe has the complete sequence of screens that the user will encounter.  But being low fidelity it lacks flow connections, colour, images/symbols

- the prototype is the final product. It is high fidelity and has the things missing in wireframe. To see the flow change tab to Prototype in right and click on play button for Flow1 near home frame
